.. topic:: Abstract

   This document describes the *SeismicMesh* package.  *SeismicMesh* provides
   the capability to build two and three dimensional quality triangular meshes
   using signed distance functions, which are intended for finite element simulation.
   Besides mesh generation, this work aims to create end-to-end workflows to build
   quality two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) unstructured triangular and tetrahedral
   meshes for seismic domains suitable for numerical wave propagators.

   The package uses Python to wrap computationally intensive operations
   performed using the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library and Boost
   that are written in C++.
