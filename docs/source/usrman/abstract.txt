.. topic:: Abstract

   This document describes the *SeismicMesh* package.  *SeismicMesh* provides
   the capability to build two and three dimensional quality triangular meshes
   using signed distance functions, which are intended for finite element simulation.

   The package uses Python3+ to wrap computationally intensive operations
   performed using the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library and Boost
   that are written in C++.
