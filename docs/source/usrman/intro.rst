Introduction
============

Generating a high-quality simplicial mesh for a geophysical
domain represents a modern challenge for sophiscated geophysical simulation workflows.
In these applications, a domain is discretized with simplicial elements (triangles/tetrahedrals)
that adapt in size to features of interest, while considering numerical
aspects. These meshes are commonly used with Finite Element and Finite volume methods to solve
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Considering this, 



Why *another* mesh generator?
